granadilla
==========

This django-backed software provides a simple administration tool for a minimal LDAP directory:

* Web application providing a clean, editable phonebook (including pictures)
* Command-line tool to manage users and groups

It has been designed for the specific LDAP setup at Polyconseil, but could be useful to other teams/companies.

Configuration
-------------

The webapp can run either in a standalone mode (with the ``granadilla_webapp.settings`` setup)
or integrated in a larger website; the required settings are listed in ``granadilla/conf.py``.

The command-line tool is designed for standalone use, and reads its settings from the ``/etc/granadilla/settings.ini`` file.
This file is also used by the webapp if launched in standalone mode, with ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=granadilla_webapp.settings``.

The valid configuration values are described in the ``example_settings.ini`` file.
